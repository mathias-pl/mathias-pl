# Hello, I'm Mathias! 👋

## About Me 🫀
Hi there! I'm Mathias Nahuel Pacheco Lemina, a passionate U4 Computer Engineering student at McGill University 🇨🇦. In the past years, I've tried many things related to technology, but also in multiple other fields such as entrepreneurship and sports. People around me would say I'm curious, and indeed I love gaining as much knowledge as possible. 🔭

When I'm not coding or working on projects, you can find either at the soccer field ⚽️, running outside (even during winter❄️), or at the gym 💪... But let's be honest, I'm probably in my room reading books! 📚

## Skills 🧠
- **Programming Languages:** Java, Python, C, ARM Assembly, VHDL
- **Technologies:** Windows, MacOS, Linux, Jupyter Notebook, ROS
- **Software:** JetBrains IDEs, VS Code, Microsoft Office suite, Notion
- **Interests:** Data Science, FPGA/Assembly, Back-End Development

## Projects & experiences ⚙️
I've worked on various projects, ranging from low-level programming to front-end development. Each project reflects my commitment to broaden my knowledge of the different opportunities in the tech world. Here are a few notable projects:

NOTE: School projects cannot be shared due to possible plagiarism by other students*

1. **McGill Robotics🤖:** Part of the drone software team. We're currently in the learning phase, and mostly running simulations on *Gazebo*. We will learn to use *Jetson Nano* to run computer vision software for navigation and payload delivery.
2. **Hotel Management App🏨:** In a team of 7, we created a fully functional app usable on any desktop by using *JavaFX and Graddle*. We learned the basic principles of *APIs and persistence*, as we also created the back-end. We learned how to use Cucumber/Gherkin to take a *Behavior-Driven Development* approach. We collaborated using *GitHub, CodeWithMe, and Discord*.
3. **Maze game using ARM Assembly and C🗺️:** I developped a fully playable maze game that can run on any *DE1-SoC FPGA board*. I used *CPUlator* for the development. I wrote the *VGA and PS/2 keyboard drivers* to be able to interact with a keyboard and have an output on the screen. Those drivers are reused in a fractal generator available publicly on my profile.

4. **Coordination of a whole soccer referee department⚽️:** This one is not entirely related to technology, but it has been one of my biggest professional challenges. During the period of a summer, I managed mostly by myself the soccer referee department of l'Association Régionale de Soccer Concordia (ARSC - Montréal, QC, Canada). We had to face multiple challenges related to a change in our CRM used for most of our operations (Spordle ID/Play). Other factors made that year particularly challenging. At the end of the day, I've been able to manage everything with hard work, good team work, and great communication with all of the 200+ referees I was in charge of.
5. **Entrepreneurship classes📊:** During summer 2022, I registered for Startup School, a series of webinars held by Y Combinator, one the biggest technology startups accelerators in the world. During winter 2023, I followed my interest in startups by taking online classes with Entrepreneuriat Québec to learn more about how to manage a startup.
